<br />
I am a computer engineering student, passionate especially about web development and AI. I enjoy researching and learning new things. I love what I do and always put my best effort into it.

<br />
<br />
I love coffee, chocolate, almonds, and books. I'm a big fan of fantasy and fiction, and if you ask, I'll always be reading a book.
